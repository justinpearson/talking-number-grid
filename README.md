> "I want to make a simple website that shows a grid of numbers from 1 to 100, and when you click on a number, it speaks the name of the number. Here's an empty repo to work in. The README.md has a link to a pic of how I'd like the buttons styled. Use speech synthesis API. Then configure the repo to publish to Github Pages."
